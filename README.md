## backend ⚙️

This section outlines potential models for food recommendations within the Fodie Basket BEATS app.

### Neural Collaborative Filtering

* **Model:** Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) leverages neural networks to model user-item interactions. Unlike traditional Collaborative Filtering methods that rely on matrix factorization with a linear dot product, NCF can learn more complex and non-linear relationships between users and items.
* **How it works:** The model typically takes user and item embeddings (learned representations) as input, passes them through multiple neural network layers, and outputs a prediction score indicating the likelihood of a user interacting with an item. Different neural architectures (e.g., Multi-Layer Perceptron, Neural Matrix Factorization) can be employed.
* **Recommendation:** By training the NCF model on historical user-order data, it can learn which food items are likely to be preferred by a user based on the preferences of similar users.

### Content-Based Filtering

* **Model:** Content-Based Filtering recommends items to a user based on the features of items they have interacted with in the past.
* **How it works:** This approach first creates a profile for each item, describing its attributes (e.g., cuisine type, ingredients, dietary restrictions). It also builds a user profile based on the items the user has liked or ordered, reflecting their preferences for certain features. Recommendations are then made by matching the user profile to the item profiles.
* **Recommendation:** For Fodie Basket BEATS, if a user has frequently ordered Italian food with cheese, a content-based system would recommend other Italian dishes or cheesy items, even if other users haven't necessarily ordered those specific combinations.
