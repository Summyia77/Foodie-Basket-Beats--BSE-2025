## backend ⚙️

This section outlines potential models for food recommendations within the Fodie Basket BEATS app.

### Neural Collaborative Filtering

* **Model:** Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) leverages neural networks to model user-item interactions. Unlike traditional Collaborative Filtering methods that rely on matrix factorization with a linear dot product, NCF can learn more complex and non-linear relationships between users and items.
* **How it works:** The model typically takes user and item embeddings (learned representations) as input, passes them through multiple neural network layers, and outputs a prediction score indicating the likelihood of a user interacting with an item. Different neural architectures (e.g., Multi-Layer Perceptron, Neural Matrix Factorization) can be employed.
* **Recommendation:** By training the NCF model on historical user-order data, it can learn which food items are likely to be preferred by a user based on the preferences of similar users.

### Content-Based Filtering

* **Model:** Content-Based Filtering recommends items to a user based on the features of items they have interacted with in the past.
* **How it works:** This approach first creates a profile for each item, describing its attributes (e.g., cuisine type, ingredients, dietary restrictions). It also builds a user profile based on the items the user has liked or ordered, reflecting their preferences for certain features. Recommendations are then made by matching the user profile to the item profiles.
* **Recommendation:** For Fodie Basket BEATS, if a user has frequently ordered Italian food with cheese, a content-based system would recommend other Italian dishes or cheesy items, even if other users haven't necessarily ordered those specific combinations.

## technologies used 🛠️

* **Flutter:** An open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It's used to develop cross-platform applications from a single codebase for web, mobile, desktop, and embedded devices. Flutter is known for its fast development with features like Hot Reload, its expressive and flexible UI, and its native performance.
    * *Example:* You can build both the Android and iOS versions of this food delivery app using the same Flutter codebase.
* **Dart:** The programming language that powers Flutter. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based language with C-style syntax. It's optimized for building fast apps on any platform and can compile to machine code, JavaScript, or WebAssembly.
    * *Example:* All the logic for handling user interactions, managing the cart, and updating the UI in the Fodie Basket BEATS app would be written in Dart.
* **Firebase:** Google's platform for building mobile and web applications. It provides various backend services like authentication, databases (Cloud Firestore, Realtime Database), storage, and more.
    * *Example:* Firebase could be used for user authentication (login/signup), storing the food menu and order data (using Cloud Firestore), and storing images of the food items (using Cloud Storage).
* **Kaggle Notebook:** A web-based environment that allows you to write and run code (primarily Python and R), analyze data, and collaborate. It's often used for data science and machine learning tasks.
    * *Example:* Data scientists could use Kaggle Notebooks to prototype and train the recommendation models (NCF, Content-Based) using historical order data.
* **VS Code (Visual Studio Code):** A popular and free source code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports a wide range of programming languages through extensions and offers features like debugging, syntax highlighting, and integrated Git control.
    * *Example:* Developers would likely use VS Code to write the Flutter/Dart code for the front-end and potentially Python for backend recommendation logic.
* **Android:** A mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, primarily designed for touchscreen mobile devices.
    * *Example:* The user-facing part of the Fodie Basket BEATS app would run on Android devices, allowing users to browse and place orders.
